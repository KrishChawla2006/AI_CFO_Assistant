2. Clone the Repository
code
Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-cfo-assistant.git
cd ai-cfo-assistant
3. Set Up a Python Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment.
code
Bash

code
Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Download the Ollama LLM Model
After installing Ollama, make sure its service is running. Then, open your terminal and pull the language model required by the application. This will download several gigabytes.
code
Bash
ollama run llama2:7b-chat
6. Configure Environment Variables
Create a file named .env in the root directory of the project. Copy the contents of .env.example (if provided) or use the template below.
code
Dotenv
# .env file

# A secret key for Flask sessions. Generate a random one for production.
FLASK_SECRET='a_very_secret_and_random_key_for_your_app'

# The base URL for your running Ollama instance (default is usually correct).
OLLAMA_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:11434"

# The name of the Ollama model to use. Must match the one you downloaded.
OLLAMA_MODEL="llama2:7b-chat"
7. Run the Application
Once the setup is complete, run the Flask application.
code
Bash
python app.py
The application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your web browser.
